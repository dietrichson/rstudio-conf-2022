## Mobile

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Helps create/maintain a feedback loop for instructors using zoon/teams/meet
- Requires no institutional buy-in
- Low barrier to entry

## Mobile - The Feedback Loop

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
The mobile app helps instructors create an effective feedback-loop with their students.

- Ideal for video conference based instruction
- Also used in hybrid settings
- Mitigates learning loss

## Mobile: Feedback

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Feedback templates are based on star ratings and free text input of *concepts learned* and *concepts for review*
- The feedback is typically requested immediately after a zoom session
- The templates have been kept short and to the point, allowing students to provide feedback in two minutes or less

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r out.height="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/english_03/X2 Mobile - English (10).png")
```

## Mobile: Extensions
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Mobile also used in hybrid setups
- Can connect to Kai for cohort recommendations
- Connects to Kai and Content repo for Content Recommendations

## Mobile: Content Recommendations

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Content recommendations are offered when a smaller group of students have shows problems with a particular topic
- This saves classroom time and reduces strain on the instructor
- Recommendations can be deployed through mobile or LMS if integrated
- Relevant assessments can be recommended

## Mobile: Email Interface

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

- Reporting takes place via email
- Reduces dashboard fatigue
- Increases likelihood that information is actually consumed by instructor ([Dietrichson & Whitmer(2018))

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/Kai_email_01.png")
```

## Mobile: Email Interface


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- When content and cohort recommendations are avaiable (courtesy of Kai), these too will be pushed through the email interface.
- Instructors may choose to accept or reject the recommendations (or do nothing). Actions are recorded by Kai for continous personalization and model tuning.

## Adaptive Assessment

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Allows instructors and/or institutions to efficiently assess student ability ($\theta$).
- Reduces cost involved in creation of test items
- Reduces frustration related to "long-form" assessment
- Requires a test-item repository

## Adaptive Assessment: Create Test Bank

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

## Adaptive Assessment: Review and Preview

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- Once the selection has been made and filters applied, the instructor may review all the test items
- Alternatively they can opt for a preview, in which they will take the assessment offered by the test engine
